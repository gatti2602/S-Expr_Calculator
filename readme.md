S-Expression Calculator
=======================
This is my implementation of an S-Expression calculator in python. 

To run execute `src/main.py operation`

Note: Created for **Python 3**, small changes needed in code to run it in Python 2.

## Features
### 1. Support for operations
Implemented **add** and **multiply**. Code prepared to extend to more operations with minimal changes. 

### 2. Multi operands 
Designed to support n operands from scratch

### 3. Simple readable code
Calculator core code has less than 50 easy to read lines.

### 4. Good practices
Added unit testing using pytest, following PEP8 coding style.
